In recent years, sentiment analysis has received a lot of attention, with end-user reviews emerging as a pivotal factor in assessing the quality of a book's content (Azhaguramyaa et al. 2022). This study draws inspiration from existing research, delving into the realm of sentiment analysis within the context of book reviews. The project revolves around implementing sentiment analysis on the Goodreads book reviews dataset, accessible at https://mengningwan.github.io/data/goodreads. This dataset, comprising user reviews with associated attributes, serves as the foundation for exploring the impact of class imbalance on sentiment analysis model performance. To achieve this, various preprocessing methods and diverse classifiers will be employed to effectively classify book reviews into positive or negative sentiments. The research includes experiments on both the original imbalanced dataset and a rebalanced version achieved through balancing techniques.
