Depression is a significant public health issue, affecting an estimated 280 million people globally (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, n.d.). According to the World Health Organization, depression contributes to a wide range of adverse health and social outcomes (World Health Organization, 2017). A key challenge in depression prevention is its heterogeneity, which clinicians recognize. Lynall and McIntosh (2023) note that this variability makes diagnosis an imperfect guide to selecting the most effective treatment.
Online discussions collected from social media platforms offer valuable insights into the personal experiences associated with depression and a fertile ground for machine learning models. A significant amount of analysis is devoted to identifying demographic, symptomatic, and physiological clusters of depression. Online posts and conversations provide unique insight into the personal experience of depression and a direct window into an individual's thoughts on depression. However, due to the unstructured nature of these discussions, it is challenging to extract meaningful themes.
To address these challenges, this work utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the varied spectrum of online discussions about depression. Specifically, it employs the topic modeling algorithms Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and BERTopic, to identify and examine the recurring themes within these discussions. In doing so, this research seeks to illuminate the heterogeneous landscape of depression.
